						While the need for blood is universal, access to it is sadly not. There is a major imbalance in access to safe blood between developing and industrialized countries. Only about 40 percent of the blood collected each year is donated in developing countries, which are home to over 80 percent of the world’s population. 

An overwhelming 99 percent of the 500,000 women who die each year during pregnancy and childbirth live in developing countries. The Ministry of Health stated, “Blood is needed regularly for patients with diseases such as Thalassemia and Haemophilia, & also for the treatment of injuries after an accident, major surgeries, Anaemia, etc.

Thus, blood donation can save lives.” Educating students about blood donation would motivate them to become a blood donor after they reach the suitable age, they can also help in creating awareness and ask others to donate blood.

Donating blood, not only saves multiple lives but also give an opportunity to add value to your life. It helps in teaching students about humanity and also defines the spirit of our natural co-existence in the most extraordinary way.
